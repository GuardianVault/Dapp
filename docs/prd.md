# Guardian Vault ‚Äî Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## üìå Project Name

**Guardian Vault**
*Decentralized, Social-Recovery Bitcoin Wallet Built on the Internet Computer (ICP)*

---

## üéØ Vision

To make Bitcoin secure, seedless, and recoverable for everyday users by delivering a social-recovery wallet powered by ckBTC, running entirely on-chain via the Internet Computer. Guardian Vault combines web-native access, guardian-based key recovery, and animated visual UX into a seamless, trustless experience across platforms.

---

## üß© Problem Statement

Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralization and security, user-level custody remains a pain point:

* Lost seed phrases = lost funds
* Custodial wallets = compromised control
* Poor recovery options discourage mass adoption
* Lack of usable interfaces for Bitcoin smart custody

Users deserve a wallet that:

* Has **no seed phrases**
* Is **non-custodial** by design
* Allows **social recovery** if access is lost
* Works across **web, mobile, and browser** surfaces
* Is visually engaging and trustworthy

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Summary

Guardian Vault is a multi-surface, decentralized wallet that enables:

* **Secure ckBTC custody** in a canister (secured by threshold ECDSA)
* **Guardian-based recovery** via encrypted key shares and quorum-based approval
* **Multi-surface access**: Web dApp, PWA, and Browser Extension
* **Full identity abstraction**: Powered by Internet Identity v2 (passkeys, WebAuthn)
* **SVG-style animated UI** that responds to actions, uses synchronized brand colors, and enhances user trust

Users can access Guardian Vault through a unified landing website, which links directly to the dApp interface and extension, and installs as a PWA for mobile use.
